Knee Condition Classification Pipeline

This repository contains the full pipeline for classifying knee conditions using high-dimensional medical data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, model training with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and generation of prediction outputs for submission.

🔧 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/knee-classification.git
cd knee-classification

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔎 Pipeline Overview

1. Data Preprocessing

Removed ID column for training

Imputed missing values using mean strategy

Standardized features with StandardScaler

2. Feature Engineering

Applied SelectKBest with mutual information to reduce dimensionality (selected top 500 features)

3. Model Training

Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers:

Logistic Regression (liblinear, C tuned)

SVM (Linear kernel, tuned C)

Random Forest (tuned n_estimators, max_depth, and max_features)

XGBoost (regularized boosting model)

VotingClassifier ensemble combining top 3 models

4. Evaluation Metrics

Reported for each model:

Accuracy

AUROC

Recall (Sensitivity)

Specificity

F1-Score

5. Prediction Output

Generated predicted class probabilities for test and blind_test

Saved as CSVs with format:

ID, Class_0_Prob, Class_1_Prob

📄 Deliverables

Source code to reproduce results (src/train_models.py)

🚀 Future Improvements

Add class balancing with SMOTE or weights

Explore deep learning models (MLP, CNN for imaging)

Use SHAP for model explainability
